# mission-6a

This was a group based project (2 UX/UI Designers, 2 Developers) where the aim was to implement at minimum one page per developer with frontend and backend functionality according to the design and functional needs provided by our UX/UI designers. This project had a timespan of two weeks starting in Week 6 and ending in Week 8.

The main focus of the project was to provide mock experience working in an agile environment while also incorporating scrum activites such as daily standup meetings and project Kanban boards.

The developers who contributed to the codebase are:
